# inventory-app
A back-end application that allows you to interact with a database and perform CRUD operations on items and associated categories.

I built this app to help practice using Node.js, express, and mongoose.  It uses MongoDB Atlas to store the item and category information.

## Items
Each item has an autogenerated ID, name, description, category, price, and amount in stock properties associated with it.  The category property is linked to the category collection by the associated ID.

## Categories
Each category has an autogenerated ID, name, and description.

## Functionality
In this app the user can navigate between pages that read the database and display item and category inforation. The user can also create new items/categories, update existing items/categories, and delete existing items/categories.
